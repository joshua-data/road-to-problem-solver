    "* You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n",
    "* You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n",

    "> * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "> * Output: 5\n",
    "> * **Explanation**: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.\n",
    "> * Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\n",

    "0. This task was really difficult, and after hours of thinking with no solution in sight, I eventually took a peek at the answer and focused on the concept of profit to write the solution myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, I iterated through each point in time and performed the following three calculations:\n",
    "    * `min_price`: The lowest price from the start to the current point.\n",
    "    * `profit`: The profit if I sell at the current point.\n",
    "    * `max_profit`: The maximum profit achievable from the start to the current point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For example, the process looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | - | Time 0 | Time 1 | Time 2 | Time 3 | Time 4 | Time 5 |\n",
    "    | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n",
    "    | `price` | 7 | 1 | 5 | 3 | 6 | 4 |\n",
    "    | `min_pricce` | 7 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n",
    "    | `profit` | 0 | 0 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 3 |\n",
    "    | `max_profit` | 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "3. So, the solution should return the `max_profit` achievable so far.\n",
    "\n",
